# TwitchRecover with Cloudflare bypass

First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the original author of https://github.com/tanersb/TwitchRecover for their amazing work. This project is built upon their optimization.

Usage: 

1. As a first step, run pip install -r requirements.txt to install required packages

2. Using a Twitch Tracker or Streams Charts link: 

        You can use the Twitch Tracker or Streams Charts link of a stream to directly get the VOD links. 


        i.e. https://twitchtracker.com/blastpremier/streams/46313458365


        i.e. https://streamscharts.com/channels/blastpremier/streams/46313458365

3. Download the zip file (I use VS Code and the Code Runner plugin to run, but you can run it wherever you prefer).

4. Sign up at https://scrapingant.com/ and go to https://app.scrapingant.com/dashboard to copy your API key.

5. In the code editor, locate the variable api_key and replace the value with your API key (e.g., api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"), then save the file.
